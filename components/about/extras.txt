I always have been
                fascinated with mathematics and physical sciences so post-high
                school I decided to pursue a degree in Chemical Engineering.
                Surprisingly I fell in love with software engineering during my
                studies while building data-based solutions for flow patterns,
                the optimzation of reactions, and development of emperical
                models. From there my addiction to developing solutions with
                technology grew.
